    "It is still work in progress.\n",

    "## What is GLIF?\n",
    "\n",
    "GLIF is a framework for prototyping natural language understanding (NLU) pipelines.\n",
    "For us, an NLU pipeline consists of three steps:\n",
    "1. parsing,\n",
    "2. semantics construction,\n",
    "3. semantic/pragmatic analysis.\n",
    "For example, let us consider the sentence *John and Mary laugh*.\n",
    "Parsing gives us an abstract syntax tree (AST).\n",
    "The semantics construction maps the AST to a logical expression: *laugh(john) ∧ laugh(mary)*.\n",
    "These first two steps correspond to the Montague-style approach to natural language semantics.\n",
    "The third step, semantic/pragmatic analysis, can be used for further, inferential processing (e.g. disambiguation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the three steps is based on an existing, specialized framework:\n",
    "1. Parsing is based on the [**Grammatical Framework** (**GF**)](http://www.grammaticalframework.org/).\n",
    "2. The semantics construction and the logic development are based on [MMT](https://uniformal.github.io/).\n",
    "3. The semantic/pragmatic analysis is based on [ELPI](https://github.com/lpcic/elpi).\n",
    "GLIF connects these three frameworks into a natural language understanding framework."
